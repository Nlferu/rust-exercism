# Introduction

Reversing strings (reading them from right to left, rather than from left to right) is a surprisingly common task in programming.

For example, in bioinformatics, reversing the sequence of DNA or RNA strings is often important for various analyses, such as finding complementary strands or identifying palindromic sequences that have biological significance.

Instructions
Your task is to reverse a given string.

Some examples:

- Turn "stressed" into "desserts".
- Turn "strops" into "sports".
- Turn "racecar" into "racecar".

\* Bonus
Test your function on this string: uuÌˆu and see what happens. Try to write a function that properly reverses this string. Hint: grapheme clusters

To get the bonus test to run, remove the ignore flag (#[ignore]) from the last test, and execute the tests with:

`$ cargo test --features grapheme`

You will need to use external libraries (a crate in rust lingo) for the bonus task. A good place to look for those is crates.io, the official repository of crates.
